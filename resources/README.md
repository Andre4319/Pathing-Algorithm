# Map Guideline
* Maps should contain atleast one start and one end node
* Maps that are 3d need to be adjusted to include a border so that a map of a 9x9 size in a 2x2 grid should be 19x19 instead of 18x18
* If there are more than one origin and end point included, all will be overriden by the last occuring one
* It is of grave importance that you follow the color reference provided :smile:
