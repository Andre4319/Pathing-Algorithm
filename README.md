# Description:
Creating an algorithm that efficiently chooses a path from a starting point
to an endpoint in a two-dimensional grid containing nontraversable
obstacles.

# Goals:
- [X] Week 1: Creating a grid with objects representing points (traversed
and not yet traversed), obstacles (nontraversable), and starting points
and endpoints. Creating a visual representation of the traversal from
one point to another.

- [X] Week 2-3: Creating a reasonably efficient algorithm for finding a path
from a starting point to an endpoint.

- [X] Optional: Adding more grids (maps with different obstacles) to test
the algorithm.

- [ ] Optional: Refining the algorithm.

- [ ] Optional: Extending the algorithm to three-dimensional grids
