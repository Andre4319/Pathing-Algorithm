# Description:
Creating an algorithm that efficiently chooses a path from a starting point to an endpoint in a three-dimensional grid containing nontraversable obstacles.


# Goals:
- Creating a grid with objects representing points (traversed and not yet traversed), obstacles (nontraversable), and starting points and endpoints.

- Creating a visual representation of the traversal from one point to another.

- Creating a reasonably efficient algorithm for finding a path from a starting point to an endpoint.

- Adding more grids (maps with different obstacles) to test the algorithm.

- Optional: Refining the algorithm.
